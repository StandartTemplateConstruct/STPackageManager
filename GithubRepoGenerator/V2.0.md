 - any command accepts github credentials and the name of organization
   - `--auth` credentials  
 - `fetch` fetches all repositories of that organization
 - `generate` generates repositories from `README.md` of the projects just like `V1.0` would 
 - `generate-commits` splits repository onto historical commits using **GitRepoCommitSplitAI**
    - `--users USERS.json` randomly populated by users signed up on [LandingPage](https://github.com/StandartTemplateConstruct/STLandingPage)
 - `publish` publishes repo to `ProjectName/ProjectName` in its own organization
